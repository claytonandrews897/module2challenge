# Portfolio

## Description

This is my custom portfolio that features my name, a picture of me, access to leaving contact information, and previous applications I have worked on.

My motivation for this project is to create a custom porfolio to present myself in a professional manner as if to present it to a potential employer. 
- This project was able to be completed due to the need for potential employers to have access to a portfolio that is able to describe me for future employment.
-The problem this program solves is it gives me a portfolio to display myself, that portfolio can be accessible to anyone
